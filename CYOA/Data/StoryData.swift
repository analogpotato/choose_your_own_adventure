        This is page 4 and this is the real test, because I need to see how adding a large amount of data will affect not only the label size, but button positions and scrolling affect.  I also want to test how the data entry of the story will look on the StoryData screen.  If I can lay it out in such a way that it will be easy to follow, find and fix an error, and just in general terms look good.  I am going to keep typing because I imagine that Lindsey and Kelsey both want to have many lines of text in each page. They are also going to want to format it like a book, so paragraphs, quotes, new lines, etc.  This will be a TODO for me to find out how to format this in XCODE.  I think I can just do \n and that will create a new line for me.  This however means that I will have a lot more data entry work than I originally thought as I will have to make sure formating is the way they intended.  This being said, I need to ask if I can have sections of the book as they are finished and then set a goal of inputting 1 or 2 pages every day.  If Lindsey and Kelsey get ahead of me with the writing I will have to increase the number of pages I input everyday.  \n THE KEY IS TO NOT GET BURNT OUT! \n another key is to keep typing, this amount of text does not go off the screen yet \n I am going to need to develop a complete testing program for this.\n I don't understand what I am doing with this scroll view stuff :(
